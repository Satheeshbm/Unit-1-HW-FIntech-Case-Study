## Overview and Origin

* Blockstream

* The company was incorporated in 2014

* The company was founded by Alex Fowler, Erik Svenson, Gregory Maxwell, Jonathan Wilkins, Jorge Tim√≥n, Mark Friedenbach, Matt Corallo, Pieter Wuille

* The founders were looking to find an architecturally sound and permissionless way to extend bitcoin; which would enable cryptocurrencies to grow and be adopted to its full potential. The current bitcoin environment was not allowing it to pace rapidly due to its constraints like protocol simplifications and scalability inturn leading to fragmentation of the cryptocurrency environment bifurcating it with new cryptocurrencies instead of building it.

* The company has recieved 5 rounds of funding so far. The company raised $21 Mn in seed funding in 2014. In 2016, $57 Mn in Series A and then $11 Mn in convertible note. It has raised $299 Mn till date including the latest Series B funding. They have 9 lead investors and have 28 investors in the company till date. In the short lifespan of less than 10 years, the company has already acquired 3 organisations - the latest being SponDoolies-Tech, a company that builds mining rigs. This company is already a unicorn, with a valuation as on Aug 2021 @ $3.2 Bn


## Business Activities:

* The main problem that this company was incorporated was with the idea to improve the scalability and decentralisation in the cryptocurrency environment specific to Bitcoin. Although altchain, another blockchain, was addressing this issue, this was more working in silos with the independent cryptocurrency environment and was hence very difficult to support innovation and inoperability.

* Blockstream's customer base includes individual and corporate clients involved in trading of bitcoins and other 18 cryptos that they trade in and also serves miners with a platform for mining using their technology with high hash rates. 

* The products from Blockstream allows trading of liquid assets of over 18 cryptocurrencies across the world in a secure and user-friendly platform to trade and acquire new assets inc smart contracts. They also provide mining infrastructure to eligible miners.

* They use a technology called as 'pegged sidechains' which enables the transferability of bitcoin and other ledger assets; thereby enabling the user to access new and innovative cryptos.

## Landscape:

* This company falls under the domain of blockchain and crytocurrency in Fin Tech. 

* The recent trend in blockchain technology was seen in tracking of vaccines from the point of production to the last point of vaccinating an individual in tracking the vaccine at all stages by different people without any security risks of loss or misuse of vaccines produced. Enterprise blockchain, apart from the use in cryptocurrency is being seen as a future trend including its use in the BFSI industry, Healthcare, Manufacturing and Distribution. NFTs are using the blockchain technology for trade of such digital assets inc music, art, codes, contracts etc. Blockchain as a service is fast picking up inc cloud computing, IOT and AI. 

* The major competitors to Blockstream are other startups like US based Kadena, Blockstack, Messari and UK based Ox.

## Recommendations

* The company could widen the product suite to include stablecoins trading in the coming days.

* Stablecoins and the confidence in stablecoins are fast picking up as compared to traditional cryptocurrency and there could be a huge market potential if the trading of such coins can also be done thru the existing platform like liquid in place.  

* The new product suite to transact the stablecoins which is increasing in popularity can use the existing technology itself to support in trade and to increase market share. 

* The current technology in use, specific to trading of crypto and smart contracts can be used to trade stablecoins as well.
