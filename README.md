## Overview and Origin

* Blockstream

* The company was incorporated in 2014

* The company was founded by Alex Fowler, Erik Svenson, Gregory Maxwell, Jonathan Wilkins, Jorge Timón, Mark Friedenbach, Matt Corallo, Pieter Wuille

* The founders were looking to find an architecturally sound and permissionless way to extend bitcoin; which would enable cryptocurrencies to grow and be adopted to its full potential. The current bitcoin environment was not allowing it to pace rapidly due to its constraints like protocol simplifications and scalability inturn leading to fragmentation of the cryptocurrency environment bifurcating it with new cryptocurrencies instead of building it.

* The company has recieved 5 rounds of funding so far. The company raised $21 Mn in seed funding in 2014. In 2016, $57 Mn in Series A and then $11 Mn in convertible note. It has raised $299 Mn till date including the latest Series B funding. They have 9 lead investors and have 28 investors in the company till date. In the short lifespan of less than 10 years, the company has already acquired 3 organisations - the latest being SponDoolies-Tech, a company that builds mining rigs. This company is already a unicorn, with a valuation as on Aug 2021 @ $3.2 Bn


## Business Activities:

* The main problem that this company was incorporated was with the idea to improve the scalability and decentralisation in the cryptocurrency environment specific to Bitcoin. Although altchain, another blockchain, was addressing this issue, this was more working in silos with the independent cryptocurrency environment and was hence very difficult to support innovation and inoperability.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? 

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.) They use a technology called as 'pegged sidechains' which enables the transferability of bitcoin and other ledger assets; thereby enabling the user to access new and innovative cryptos.
